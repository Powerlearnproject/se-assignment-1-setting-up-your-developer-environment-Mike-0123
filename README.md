OTHER EXPLANATION WE CAN USE THE GIT DOCUMENTATION IN ORDER TO START USING IT ( https://www.git-scm.com/docs)

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
   Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

STEPS TO INSTALL THE PROGRAMMING

1. Grab Python:

Head to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Look for the big, clear download button! 2. Run the Installer:

Double-click the downloaded file.
Follow the on-screen instructions. It's usually pretty straightforward â€“ just click "Next" a few times.
Important Tip: During installation, look for an option that says something like "Add Python to PATH" or "Make Python available from command line" (exact wording might vary). Make sure to check this box! This makes running Python commands super easy later. 3. Check It's Working (Optional):

Open your terminal or command prompt window (search for "command prompt" or "terminal" on your computer).
Type python --version (or python3 --version on some systems) and press Enter. If you see the installed Python version displayed, you're good to go!

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   STEPS TO INSTALL THE PIPS AFTER INSTALL THE PYTHON
   -Python Installation: When you install Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/), the package manager pip is automatically bundled and installed with it.
   -Adding Python to PATH: During the installation process, there might be an option to "Add Python to PATH" or make it available from the command line. Checking this option ensures you can easily access pip from your terminal or command prompt.
   Verifying pip Installation (Optional):

   -Open your terminal or command prompt window.
   Type pip --version and press Enter. If pip is installed correctly, you'll see the installed version displayed (e.g., pip 21.x.x).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   STEPS TO INSTALL THE MYSQL

   1. Download the MySQL Installer (Considered Done):

   We'll assume you're using Windows for this example. The download link for the MySQL installer on Windows has already been provided: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   Downloaded? Great! Let's move on to the next step.

   2. Run the MySQL Installer:

Locate the downloaded installer file (usually an .msi file). It might be in your "Downloads" folder or wherever your web browser saves downloaded files.

Double-click the downloaded installer to launch the installation process.

Follow the on-screen instructions: The installation wizard will guide you through the process. You might encounter options like choosing a "Typical" or "Custom" installation. Here's a simplified explanation of each:

Typical Installation: This option installs the most common components you'll need for a basic MySQL setup. It's a good choice for most users.
Custom Installation: This option allows you to choose specific components to install. Unless you have a specific reason to customize, the "Typical" installation should suffice.
Important: During installation, you'll be prompted to set a root password for MySQL. The root user is the most powerful user in MySQL and is used for administrative tasks. Choose a strong and secure password! Write it down somewhere safe, as you'll need it later to access your MySQL database.

3. Configure MySQL (Optional):

Once the installation is complete, you can optionally configure some additional settings for MySQL. This might involve setting up security features or configuring network access (if you plan to access the database from other machines).

For now, let's keep it simple. We can explore these configurations later if needed.

4. Verify the Installation (Optional):

You can verify if MySQL is installed and running correctly by opening a command prompt window.

In the command prompt, type mysqladmin version and press Enter. If MySQL is installed and running, you should see the MySQL version information displayed.
